General Notes:

probably best to create automation to store keys daily in DW. Maybe create a custom extractor


functions needed for pulling avails through an API:
1. DFP_date2DateTimeObj 
		# first, it's helpful to have a function that takes the current time
		# and converts it into a DFP-friendly list
		# you'll note that we add an hour if requesting for today because
		# forecasts must "start" in the future. If you use the exact time right now
		# when you create the object, then it will already be in the past by the time you 
		# submit to DFP

2. DFP_constructLineItem 
		# second create a handy function for constructing the line items
		# because it's really compicated to get the format just right, so
		# use thsi function to simply plug in the values you care about

3. DFP_constructInventoryTargetingList
	Takes a vector of GeoKeys which one filters beforehand
	could have the user select on of the larger keys to break down geographies by...
		such as select all postal codes
		
	takes single ad unit and single position to break down in many ways
	
	need to understand that last function a bit better
	
4. Custom Targeting
	If make OR class then top level logical operator equals OR.
		Everything is repeated on BOTH sides of OR except one has make and the other has class
	
	
	Step one -- Determine Number of children
		If brand or class then 2 children
		
		Could be up to 9 children if all OR targets -- one for each key
		1. class
		2. condition
		3. length
		4. make
		5. page
		6. pos
		7. site_version
		8. state
		9. type
		10. year
		
		Radio Button:
			None - All "AND" criteria
			make-OR-class
			make-OR-type
			class-OR-type
			make-OR-class-OR-type
			
		pass this within the funciton
		1. this logic passed will depend on what gets called
		
	Implementation
	1. Pass a DF - filtered down to all the key values entered
	2. Pass Radio button which identifies and-or relationships
	
	
	#current logic STEVE
	indiv_possibilities = for all criteria in key values, we get all combinations in rows 
	ct_object = an empty list with length: nrow(indiv_possibilities)+1
	ct_object[[1]] <- 'OR'
		for every indiv_possibilities rows = (values Ids)
			one_ct_object = create empty list with number of entries = ncol(indiv_possibilities) +2
			one_ct_object[[1]] <- 'AND'
			one_ct_object[[length(one_ct_object)]] <- c('type'="CustomCriteriaSet")
			names(one_ct_object) <- c('logicalOperator', rep('children', ncol(indiv_possibilities)), '.attrs')
			for every indiv_possibilities columns (keyIds)
				assign each individual KV to the list
				

			
	Level-1
	logical operator = OR
	number of children = n(OR criterias)
		level-2 (for level-1 child)
		logical operator = AND
		number of children = n(keys) - n(OR criterias) #only pick on key in OR criteria per child
		.attrs = type='CustomCriteria'
			level-3 (for each level-2 child)
			key-values = ...
			valueIds = for each valueId in Key = ...
			opeartor = IS
			.attrs = type='CustomCriteria'
		
		
		
Questions
	1. Will each page have pos?
	2. If no page targeting then ROS
	3. If no
